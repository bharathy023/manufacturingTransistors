# manufacturingTransistors - minimize cost

This is a model of a transistor manufacturing environment. The aim is to minimize the cost by 
selecting the appropriate manufacturing methods. Below is the decription of the problem.

Silvco manufactures transistors. An important aspect of the transistor manufacturing process is the 
melting of the element germanium in a furnace. Unfortunately, the melting process yields germanium 
of highly variable quality. The results of the process can be classified into five grades: “defective”, 
“grade 1”, “grade 2”, “grade 3”, and “grade 4”.Two methods can be used to do the melting. 
Method 1 costs $50 per transistor, and method 2 costs $70 per transistor. The qualities of germanium 
produced by the melting are available.

It is possible to refire melted germanium in an attempt to improve its quality. It costs $25
to refire the melted germanium for one transistor. The results of the refiring process are available. 
Silvco has sufficient furnace capacity to melt or refire germanium for at most 20,000
transistors per month. Silvco’s monthly demands are for 1000 grade-4 transistors, 2000
grade-3 transistors, 3000 grade-2 transistors, and 3000 grade-1 transistors.

Assuming that just one stage of refiring is allowed, model the melting/refiring process and
determine the minimum cost of germanium processing required to meet the demands.
